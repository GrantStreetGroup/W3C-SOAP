=item Improve XML Schema support

Currently I can't pass http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.xsd due to
not supporting unions and lists. Support for arrays probably is
also needed. The following schemas should all be abled to be passed
with out error

=item WSDL's with multiple inputs and outputs

The current code only allows for one input and zero or one output.
It looks like support for zero or more for each is required.

=item Improve test coverage

Need many more tests to make sure everything is working as expected

=item Documentation

Some very basic documentation is done but much more work is needed.

=item Server creation

Helpers to create SOAP servers, Catalyst/Dancer/Mojolicious helpers.

=item Mock services helper

Helper to create mock responces based on requests (dependant on server
creation). Should be able to work in two different ways eg a recording
opperation so that a client sends requests which the mock server proxies to
the real server, stores the results against the request and sends back the
response. The other method is to look up the request to see if their already
is a responce and returns that (the true mock opperation).

=item WS-Security

Currently the Username part of the spec has some form of implementation but
their doesn't exist a way of auto generating this or other security forms
from the WSDL.
