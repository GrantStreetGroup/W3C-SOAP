=item Tests for WSDL creation.

There are some known issues with generation of WSDL Clients, need to test for
those and other issues.

=item In memory XSD object creation

Need to dynamically create objects for any XSD found.

=item In memory WSDL object creation (soap client)

Create whole SOAP clients (ala SOAP::Lite)

=item Server creation

Helpers to create SOAP servers, Catalyst/Dancer/Mojolicious helpers.

=item Mock services helper

Helper to create mock responces based on requests (dependant on server
creation). Should be able to work in two different ways eg a recording
opperation so that a client sends requests which the mock server proxies to
the real server, stores the results against the request and sends back the
response. The other method is to look up the request to see if their already
is a responce and returns that (the true mock opperation).

=item WS-Security

Currently the Username part of the spec has some form of implementation but
their doesn't exist a way of auto generating this or other security forms
from the WSDL.
